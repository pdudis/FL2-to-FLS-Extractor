# FL2 to FLS Extractor
This tool extracts from the newer Caterpillar® Flash file format (.FL2) the older file format (.FLS), which is compatible with older versions of the Caterpillar® Electronic Technician (CAT ET) diagnostic software. Flash files are used to calibrate an Engine Control Module (ECM). The tool also displays the Flash file's Release Notes.

## Pre-built application binaries

You can download pre-built files from the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/pdudis/FL2-to-FLS-Extractor/releases) page.

## Notes

- The application uses the [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130) so you might be requested to install it if not present. Usually, this is already installed on your system.
- Your web browser and/or Windows operating system may, incorrectly, flag the download/application as not safe. The reason for this is that the software has not been signed with a developer's certificate. Since I'm not a professional developer, and certificates cost money, the tool has been left unsigned. If you're still uncertain, you can easily scan the file with your anti-virus software and see for yourself. If MS Windows blocks it, then click on the "More info" option in the displayed dialog and then click on the "Run anyway" button.
