# FL2 to FLS Extractor
This tool extracts from the newer Caterpillar速 Flash file format (.FL2) the older file format (.FLS), which is compatible with older versions of the Caterpillar速 Electronic Technician (CAT ET) diagnostic software. Flash files are used to calibrate an Engine Control Module (ECM). The tool also displays the Flash file's Release Notes.

## Notes

- The application uses the [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130) so you might be requested to install it if not present. Usually, this is already installed on your system.
- Your web browser and/or Windows operating system may, incorrectly, flag the download/application as not safe. The reason for this is that the software has not been signed with a developer's certificate. Since I'm not a professional developer, and certificates cost money, the tool has been left unsigned. If you're still uncertain, you can easily scan the file with your anti-virus software and see for yourself. If MS Windows blocks it, then click on the "More info" option in the displayed dialog and then click on the "Run anyway" button.
